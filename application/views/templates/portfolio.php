Languages used: PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

Students from all over Southern California come together to compete in an Information Techonology Event. Students are to apply their skills in a simulated business environment. Categories consist of Business System Analysis, Computer Forensics, Computer Programming, Telecommunications, and Web Applications Development. Each category is given a case written by the judges.


The Web Application Development category was given a case to develop a website as follow:

"The purpose of this website is to have a community driven resource center for hikers and outdoor enthusiasts that will focus on delivering detailed trail write-ups submitted by users. Visitors can explore these write-ups using an interactive map, gather information and directions to the trailhead, view photos and videos of the trails, and download files for gps or similar devices useful for research before hitting the trail. Smart phones with gps services would be able to use the interactive map and have the capacity to display the user on the map for help with finding trails."
